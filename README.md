# Magical Characters

A web app that fetches and displays characters from the Harry Potter API. You can filter them by house and enjoy a magical interface.

## Observations / Questions
- I learned how to work with APIs and filters in JavaScript.
- I want to explore how to paginate results properly.

## Time Taken
- I expected this to take 3 hours, but it took 6 hours due to debugging and styling.
